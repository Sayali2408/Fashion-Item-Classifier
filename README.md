## Fashion Item Classifier

A deep learning-based image classification project built using the Fashion MNIST dataset. This project aims to accurately classify grayscale images of various fashion items into predefined categories like shirts, shoes, bags, etc.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Fashion Item Classifier leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify fashion images into 10 categories. It uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model. The goal is to achieve high accuracy while maintaining simplicity in model architecture for educational and practical purposes.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Uses Fashion MNIST dataset (60,000 training and 10,000 test images)
- ✅ Preprocessing with normalization
- ✅ CNN model architecture built with TensorFlow
- ✅ Accuracy and loss visualization
- ✅ Model evaluation on test data

## 📂 Dataset

The **Fashion MNIST** dataset is a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST dataset, but with images of clothing items instead of handwritten digits.
